== Description ==

Sermon Manager is designed to help churches easily publish sermons online. You can add speakers, sermon series, Bible references etc. 

Sermons can have audio files, as well as pdf, doc, ppt, etc adding to them. Video embeds from sites like Vimeo are also possible.

It will work with any theme, but themes can be customized to display content as you like. You'll find the template files in the /views folder.
