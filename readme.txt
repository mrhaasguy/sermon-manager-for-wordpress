== Description ==

Sermon Manager is designed to help churches easily publish sermons online. You can add speakers, sermon series, Bible references etc. 

Sermons can have audio files, as well as pdf, doc, ppt, etc adding to them. Video embeds from sites like Vimeo are also possible.

It will work with any theme, but themes can be customized to display content as you like. You'll find the template files in the /views folder. You can copy these into the root of your theme folder and customize to suit your site's design. If you need assistance, just post on the forums at WP for Church.

Two shortcodes are available to display sermons by speaker or by series.
