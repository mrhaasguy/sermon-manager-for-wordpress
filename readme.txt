Sermon Manager is designed to help churches easily publish sermons online. You can add speakers, sermon series, Bible references etc. 

Sermons can have audio files, as well as pdf, doc, ppt, etc adding to them. Video embeds from sites like Vimeo are also possible.

It will work great out of the box with any theme, but themes can be customized to display content as you like. 

Two shortcodes are available to display sermons by speaker or by series.
